ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Abdul Samad

I'm a passionate front-end developer with over 4 years of experience specializing in WordPress. I've worked extensively with various themes and plugins, creating multiple websites for clients. My expertise also extends to modern front-end technologies, where I have 2 years of experience as a React.js and nextjs specialist.

ðŸŒ± I'm broadening my skillset by delving into Node.js and backend development. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and work on creative projects that challenge me.

ðŸ’¼ In my front-end journey, I've mastered React.js, Redux, and Context API for state management. I'm also skilled in crafting responsive and visually appealing UIs using tools like Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, and Chakra UI. I've leveraged Next.js for server-side rendering, enhancing website performance.

ðŸ“« You can reach me at abbdulsamad@webiocreatives.uk or connect with me on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/abdulsamadlaghari) if you're looking to collaborate on front-end development projects.

Let's create exceptional digital experiences together! ðŸš€
